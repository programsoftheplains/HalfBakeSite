    <p>Hi there. Thanks for stopping in. Glad to say that Half Bake is here. It exists! If you're reading this, then that is self evident, but it's kind of a big deal to us so we're gonna say it again. Half Bake exists!</p>
    <p>A big thanks to all the friends that made this possible. It has been an experience. A happening. A series of events that can be clumped together in the mind, fondly.</p>
    <p>Anyways, thanks to you, too, for your time and your interest. Please, go check out <a href="volumeOne.html">Volume One</a>. We hope you find it inspiring.</p>
