    <h1 class="text">The Good News:</h1>

    <h2 class="text">We are not laywers...</h2>
    <h3 class="text">So it's hard to say if we're doing this right -</h3>
    <p class="text">But, we're gonna try.</p>
    <p class="text">So we sort of have a copyright on the zine (we think), just to protect the IP rights of each piece. The contents themselves are still owned by the people who made them, but the assembled work itself constitutes like... a thing. It took a lot of mental anguish for everyone involved to photograph/write/collage/bang-two-mallets-on-a-keyboard/etc in the service of assembling this, and we want to respect the due ownership that comes along with that. That being said, we are totally cool with you reprinting and sharing our volumes under these conditions:</p>
    <p class="text"> <font color="red">1: Print the whole volume with the acknowledgements/attribution pages intact.</font></p>
    <p class="text"><font color="red">2: Send us an email to let us know how you like the zine! We thrive on the positive attention.</font></p>
    <span class="text">That's it. Thanks in advance!</span>
