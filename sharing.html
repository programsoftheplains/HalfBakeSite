    <h2 class="text">We are not laywers...</h2>
    <h3 class="text">So it's hard to say if we're doing this right</h3>
    <p class="text">BUT! We're gonna try.</p>
    <p class="text">So we sort of have a copyright on the zine (we think), just to protect the IP rights of each piece. The contents themselves are still owned by the people who made them, but the assembled work itself constitutes like... a thing. It took a lot of mental anguish for everyone involved to photograph/write/collage/bang-two-mallets-on-a-computer and assemble this thing, and we want to respect the due ownership that comes along with that. That being said, we are totally cool with you reprinting and sharing our volumes under these conditions:</p>
    <p class="text"> <font color="red">1: Print the whole volume and keep the credits in there!</font></p>
    <p class="text"><font color="red">2: Just shoot us an email to let us know! We thrive on the positive attention.</font></p>
    <span class="text">That's it! Thanks in advance!</span>
